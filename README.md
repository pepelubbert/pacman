Project Name - Pacman!

This is a proyect that uses MIT code.

This is how it works:

If you press Add PacMan it adds a new gif to the browser, no motion.

If you press Start, every Pacman will start moving with random direction and speed, and they will bounce on webpage limits.

You can add as many PacMen you want.

If you press Start several times, it will go faster and faster. Try it out!
